title: Week Six
---

I have been looking into AngularJS on some open projects.  I've developted a few _very_ basic tests and I'm looking at how we can scale the tests moving forward. I am also looking into a joint co-design of a podcast website as a better test of shared code projects.

# Completed Items this week

All Week Code Review: General research in AngularJS including the "shopping cart" project offered directly from Angular's repo.

All Week Project Planning: Discussing ideas and plans for projects moving forward with another new dev.

## Continual work/forward plans
